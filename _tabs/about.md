I have been a software engineer from Germany since 2009. I love to program in 
C++, especially for handhelds and embedded devices.

The motivation behind this blog is to keep notes about patterns, techniques, 
and idioms I stumble over. The posts are more in a notebook style, and I will 
revisit them over time to add information and references or update them if I 
see any issues. The main goal is to show the basic ideas and use them as a 
discussion base or to remind me about the pattern and ideas.
